       "  'review_text': 'Although I\\'ve succumbed to the urge less frequently these past few years - due to finances or due to disappointment with games that didn\\'t pan out after I shelled out for the CE - I am a Collector\\'s Edition Addict. I love everything about getting one. Finding it available online! Eeee! Ordering it and knowing it\\'s coming in the mail at launch date! Eagerly awaiting for the post delivery that day of launch. Opening the brown outer carton and revealing the CE case for the first time with all of the details on it. Cracking open the CE and looking at each and every piece with giant, goggly \"kid at Christmas\" eyes. Looking through art books. Listening to soundtracks. Putting in goodie codes with mounts, pets, characters, outfit skins, etc. The whole experience, it\\'s like grown-up Christmas to me. I am 36, and I think this is about as grown-up as I care to get! May I always find joy in the little things and in new games! And may you do the same!So, Overwatch came in the mail. I got the CE through Amazon Prime at 20% off the lowest list price if made on Pre-Order. I am such a fan of this promotion that I have a few other games on pre-order in the works for the rest of the summer and year. I picked up the box and I was confused, trying to think what else I had forgotten to have ordered. My bf\\'s Origins Edition was in a separate box - so that wasn\\'t it. The thing was huge and weighed 17lbs! I brought her to my bed, cracked her open and inside was *another* box. Smaller, heavier gauge cardboard. It popped open to reveal an insane amount of cardboard lining and my Overwatch CE gently nestled inside within a sheet of plastic.So, I had my boyfriend hold down the box and I lifted the CE up and out of the carton. It was heavy, too! And as my photos will show, this thing has an insane case. It\\'s all cardboard but it\\'s *nice* - thick and there is beveling and hinges. It\\'s pretty crazy.Inside are all the goodies we were promised. And they are all gorgeous and beyond expectation. Let\\'s go over them below:1. Let\\'s go for the big guns, and what is half the interior of the CE case. The Soldier 76 statue, while plastic, is huge and gorgeous. It\\'s well molded and has a faux distressed metal patina that is spot on. It\\'s now perched upon my sexy white Destiny PS4, and it looks awesome! Since I\\'ve no interest in reselling (I buy these CEs for MY own personal joy, not resell value!) there is no way I am putting this baby aside unless I am dusting it or moving.2. The art book is a tactile experience. It\\'s sheeted in a thick plastic sleeve-case. Within that is a book with that awesome-feeling smooth rubbery coated covers. I always love that coating on a book cover. I literally bought a book once recently, in part, because when I picked it up it had that smooth, lovely coating and I love the way that feels in the hands as I read. Inside are great renditions of characters, places and such. It\\'s a beautiful book and I love that cover art, too. That would make an awesome wrap around shirt.3. Under the art book is the Steelbook case. It\\'s pretty simple and as expected, but it\\'s beautiful and always a nice touch.4. The CD, while in a disappointing paper card case, is something I always love. It has a booklet and I\\'ve already listened to the music once since getting it, while I was getting ready for bed.5. There are art postcards of each zone. Beautiful, thick paper and artwork.6. An assortment of game codes for all the other Blizzard games in the current line up. Some are the prerequisite \"Guest Pass\" codes, but others contain codes for heroes, card packs, etc. This is a nice add-on.Overall, this has been my favorite CE unveiling in - forever - and with Amazon Prime the price wasn\\'t even that bad. I think it was $103? For all the goodies, and for the experience, and the knowledge that I really enjoy the game itself (played in closed beta) you can color me a happy camper with the purchase of this CE.Do I recommend to others? Well, do you think you will like the game? It most reminds me of a gussied up, more fleshed out, Team Fortress type of game. It\\'s gorgeous, colorful, slick as hell, fast-paced and multi-layered in content and rewards for each match. You can play vs. AI or vs. Players. I am not going to go into too much here because this is mostly a review for the CE box itself, but if this interests you and you like Collector\\'s Editions I think you will be very pleased with the Overwatch CE. Hands down best CE I\\'ve ordered in years, could only be made better with perhaps a Winston or Mercy statue instead of the (imo somewhat generic dude with a gun silhouette) of the Soldier 76, and a nicer case on the soundtrack. That said, bottom line this is a 6 of 5 star item, as it exceeded my expectation and was so thrilling to unwrap it had 3 people entertained and \"Oooo\\'ing and Ahhh\\'ing\" over it.Note: I added the max of 20 shots of the box and goodies (They *are* fairly small images though - I sent them from my phone via email so had to conserve a little space!) lots of which are the outer carton to give a feel for what it\\'s like when you open it, which is at least half the fun of getting a CE. Hope this helps! And enjoy YOUR Collector\\'s Edition. Cause I am guessing by now, you want one, too! :-)UPDATE 05/31/2016: I wanted to mention that the MSRP for this item was 129.99. When I bought it through the Amazon Prime Pre-Order program it was cut down to ~$103. That is what I fully expected to pay and I felt it was a good deal for what I was getting. When I got the item - with all it\\'s goodies - I felt great about the purchase for sure. A couple days later I got an email saying that the Pre-Order Price Guarantee (which says I get the lowest price it dips to after pre-ordering and by time of release) was going to save me an additional $37.77 off the $103 price I already thought was great. So I essentially ended up getting the Collector\\'s Edition Overwatch for $65 - or ~$5 more than most folks paid for the Origins edition. Also, having bought the Origins edition for my boyfriend at the 20% off price of ~$47.99, I ended up getting $11-12 back on that, making the Origins the cost of the base edition game.I am beyond thrilled, and though I know such a savings won\\'t always happen - I am going to buy through Amazon from here on out as it is an automatic 20% off and potentially a lot more than that, when you get lucky. Just something to keep in mind.',\n",

A lot of love and care went into the design as well as the materials used for this. The soldiier 76 statue could be used as a selling point but almost everything if not everything in here is freaking quality. I'll try not to provide spoilers. Hopefully you'll get the same amount of joy I got from opening this. I will say it is more than just the game and the statue and the box of inception. Seriously it's a box in a box in a box.... From an engineer perspective it was also great seeing how innovative they were with packing all the items that they did in this box.I paid $80... I might have paid full price. As I type this it's $60. Which is a freaking steal. I actually want to buy it again so you can't get it for that much. But I remembered that I have left my evil ways.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"This collector's edition consists of a few things:- Overwatch game (in metal casing)- Artbook- Soundtrack- Postcards- Soldier 76 statue- Free codes for other gamesI'll start with the packaging. The box is huge!!! The artwork, despite being one we seen online, looks really nice on the box. I love the design of the box, although the white parts seem dirty to me. I suspect it is from the black outer casing rubbing on the white box, but it's fine with me.The game, 1 disc, is in a metal casing, which is slim and nice. It has a simple design: Tracer on the front, Reaper on the back. Inside the case is the disc, the CD key and the code for the Noire Widowmaker skin. All digital bonuses for Overwatch and the other Blizzard games are immediately redeemed once you install/register your copy of the game. This means you cannot choose to give the Hearthstone sleeves/Diablo 3 wings/Tracer hero to other friends. Just something to note.The postcards are of the various maps in the game, which is really nice to look at. I'm not really a postcards fan, so I will leave them aside.There is a soundtrack, which I have yet to open up. It comes in a compact CD casing. From what I know, it consists of the tracks heard in the game. I do not have much to comment on this.The Soldier 76 statue is the 2nd biggest reason why I bought the CE. The statue comes in its own box, and consists of the statue itself and a really heavy base. Assembling it is simple: Insert the long, metal pegs at the bottom of Soldier 76's feet into the peg holes in the base. You may need to open his legs a bit, but the statue will not suffer damage. The statue is really tall, at around 12 inches tall. And there is some weight to it. The statue does not have any colours, but he is really detailed and well-proportioned. Blizzard definitely did not cut corners with this guy.The main reason why I wanted the CE is the artbook. The artbook itself has an transparent outer sleeve/casing that has minimal design. The cover of the artbook alone is gorgeous, being a artwork by Arnold Tsang (he has done quite a lot of Overwatch artworks). The artbook shows every hero in the game and the locations, along with interesting backstory and additional information. Much of this information can actually be found online already, but to have an artbook is really something else. The pictures are really nice, although many have been seen already. There is definitely more lore in this book, along with words from the developers (although that's not something I was interested in reading)!Lastly, the CE came with codes to redeem for the other Blizzard games. Free trial for World of Warcraft, free trial for Starcraft 2, free hero for Heroes of the Storm (mine was Jaina), and codes for 3 card packs in Hearthstone. Seeing as how difficult it is to get card packs in Hearthstone, I was pleasantly surprised with that last freebie.Do I think that this set is worth it? If you are a huge Blizzard/Overwatch fan, then yes, get it. I pre-ordered it on Amazon, and got a really good deal for it (total of USD$93 only). For the price I'm paying, I feel that I was definitely getting a lot more than I paid for. If you only want to play the game, I would recommend the Origins Edition or basic edition instead!\",\n",

The shipping box contained a drop-ship box inside... inside that was the display box.  Finally, cut off the paper sleeve, and then remove the outer box, open the inner box, finally all that I was trying to get to.  Yes, the box was nice looking... that said all in all, the amount of packaging just seemed excessive, and didn't really do much considering it is a pretty big box, and I'm tossing that into the recycling bin anyway. Shipping and packaging aside, the statue is cool, and the other extras are worth the price difference above origins.The game is pretty nice, hopefully I'll get a bit better since it's been over a decade since I've played any game regularly, this caught my attention with gameplay that reminded me of Team Fortress, with modernized graphics... I've traded in my dual monitors for a single 4k display, and upped to a GTX 1080 to have playable framerates at 1440p settings.  All in all, really like the game, packaging could have been friendlier.\",\n",

Played the game in beta and I was originally going to buy the Origins Edition, but found out the collectors came with a nice artbook and Soldier:76 statue, i was sold. Blizzard definitely knows how to satisfy customers with their amazing work, packaging was beautiful (its the small things that count). Even the Boxes were amazing; boxes are so nice I can't even throw them away. Beautiful soundtrack, AMAZING art-book, I loved the Soldier: 76 bio and story they added to him in the artbook. LOVED the Soldier: 76 statue, great edition to my collection. loved the postcards. Even though I didn't need the game CD it still came in an aluminum hard cover case, still nice to put into a collection. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and will buy more Blizzard collectors editions in the future.\",\n",

Flipping through the art book while listening to the fantastic soundtrack is a lot of fun. Even the box itself is a work of art. This collector's edition comes with various in-game goodies in addition to some free cards to some other Blizzard games, like codes to try World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2 free. Which doesn't make sense since you can already get free trials without the codes, but I suppose they're more for advertisement than anything else. I definitely recommend this collector's edition. It is well worth the price. Even if you're new to first-person shooters, Overwatch is fun and easy to learn.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"Overwatch was plenty of fun during the Beta, and a game I've been anticipating highly.  My review will be based on continued experiences of the product as a collectors edition and game, thus updated on a periodic basis.The physical product was heavier than I expected, even without the figure, but really good packaging all around.  I love collectors editions, especially since digital distribution has become the prevalent market share for video games.  Boxes have always been a display item, and artwork in a sense to me, so I appreciate a good collectors edition box.  The contents of the box include the statue, which is pretty nautical so to speak; I would have preferred the statute to have colour though.  Postcards of areas where the characters originate, I assume, was really neat little addition.  The art book contained some interesting artwork that anyone should take some time to go through.  Lastly there were guest passes, free heroes and cards for other blizzard games, a black widow skin.The game itself, since I played the beta quite a bit I will say the games overall feel, theme, design, and characters are all exceptionally enjoyable.  My personal favourite characters included D.Va and Mcree. I love the exploding ability of D.va and just using the revolver was so surreal in game play as you take out an entire team like it's the old west.  One of my favourite aspects of the game is that characters each have a strong and unique personality that fits their role well.  When you play the game you don't feel like just a soldier on a Battlefield, but you serve a unique purpose to your team.  Even further, there is a wide selection of characters to choose from to fit everyone tastes.The visuals of the game play are not realistic, but quite artistic which I love about this game.  Gritty first person shooters are very generic these days, although Battlefield games are an exception in my opinion.  Great performance, visually appealing artistic graphics, and a unique style at that really make me enjoy this game.  The games performance during the beta was really good and very few problems comparatively to other betas I've been in, so I except few issues overall except minor tweaks here and there.Overall, this is a fantastic game, and I will be updating my review over periods of game play to reflect my thoughts better.  My hopes are that they listen to the community and not make defunct adjustments as seen in other games.UPDATE 1: So for this game has been really fun, and almost no issues.  Overwatch feels very polished, performs really well, and the worst thing I've encountered are server issues occasionally, but insignificant.  One thing I am glad to see is that the only micro-transactions are for the impatient, and that you do not need to buy anything; it's all cosmetic and earned by levelling or buying loot boxes.  Highlights are awesome, but at this point inconsistent feeling with actual awesome plays I've seen people do in game.Would I recommend this game, and the collectors edition? I would highly recommend it!Justice ain't gonna dispense itself, so see you all in game!\",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"For those new with Blizzard products, you might want to find a more in depth explanation over what exactly the Collector edition is, but for those with previous knowledge, and want to know about all of the goodies found inside, this is for you.Firstly, that packaging... It's glorious, I had to hesitate throwing away the exterior box just do to the quality it has, the plastics feel awesome, and the interior has a felt molded plastic to hold all of the products inside gently.It's awesome.Secondly, and the main reason I am sure most of you would consider getting this in the first place, is the Soldier 76 Statue.It probably wont blow your mind, due to it not being colored brightly, and the detail being limited in a way by that.But for minimalism sake... It's gorgeous, the dark aged grey, with the greened out metal look makes this almost feel like an ancient statue built to commemorate the heroes of this universe.I am sure almost anyone who gets it will not be disappointed.Next (And always something I love in Limited editions and such)Is the Steelbook.One side is a light grey steel of Tracer, and the other, a darker side with reaper on it.It's lovely, no complaints, I think Blizzard hit all of the marks with this oneAnd for the last few bits of paperwork, I am not huge on artwork books, even being a somewhat artist myself, going through concept art isn't exactly what I love to do... I do however love the fact it includes backstories, details about the characters and the world they exist in.Canon? Yes plz.Gorgeous graphics to go along the story? Yes plz.All in all a great bargain for your dollar? Yes plz.If you like this style of collectors editions, and have a few extra bucks to stretch out, go for this edition, you wont regret it.\",\n",

The statue was much larger and heavier than expected, very detailed and well made. The artbook is hardcover and full-sized (unlike some of the DVD case sized artbooks out there) and contains lore about Overwatch (the organization) and characters. At the time of writing, the soundtrack is only available on iTunes, so the CD is still a cool exclusive which I hope stays that way.\",\n",

This CE is cheaper than some of the WOW CEs but packs more punch than the usual stuff! Oh and there are the soundtrack, postcards of maps, 3 HS packs, 1 HOTS hero, some trial keys and the in-game cosmetic items for the other Blizz games. Blizz really provided a very good value for this CE!The game itself is a really easy to get into FPS which let's you play one of the many interesting and diverse heroes in a 6v6 team format. Most maps include fast-paced situations, competitive objectives and lots of different ways for your team of heroes to utilize their abilities in gaining the upper hand. There are a lot of unlockables and the UI is perfect. It is always a joy to play this game with the excellent audio and tight controls. The art style is colorful and excellent for the theme with lots of backstory being told to us one at a time by Blizz thru short comics and movies. It really gets you excited about what Blizz is going to expand on this universe.\",\n",

Lastly, I did get the Noire Widowmaker skin, it was in the case for the game disk, on a small card, look at all the inserts and you will find it.  All of that and the game as well!!\",\n",

But despite that this is a masterful collector's edition - the best I have ever purchased. Normally if you buy a collectors edition you get some lame art book, maybe a guide if lucky, some useless code and a low quality stature that feels it will break apart.The reality is most collectors edition are a scam to squeeze extra money by boxing up low quality products or products you will never use and forget you even own. But as I already said, no need to worry here the statue is incredible and all the items this comes with - can't remember the last time I got a high quality statue in a collectors edition.I rarely buy collectors editions but I am glad I did in this case. Hard to imagine anyone having issues with this purchase. The game itself is fun and I think heroes go along way to keep the game fresh over classes but for whatever reason I think there is a danger this game could get old somewhat fast. Probably just me but I get burned out on multiplayer pretty quickly for most games. Hoping campaigns and PvE are added later in great focus.\",\n",
